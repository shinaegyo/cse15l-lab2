   The method is handleRequest in the StringServer class.
   The argument is "/add-message" and the query s="I think Stephen Curry will average 32.4 PPG this season because he is the goat" and the relevant fields are 'letters' and 'nums'.
   The URI as well as the strings and nums changed. The URI changes every time I add another message, the number increments, and a new string(message) is added.

# 3)
Something I learned in Lab 2 and Lab 3 is running javac and then the class name then typing in the class.java with the server port number.
This allowed me to open up a new server. I also learned that I can add a query with specified letter to either increment a number and or add a string message.
The ssh command allowed me to create a remote server rather than working directly from my server. It was difficult to put one thing I learned so I including all
three things because it really helped me learn the functionalities.
